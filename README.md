This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON_SERVER
I have used json-server in this application fake mock api. If we start the development server by using `npm run dev`, I configured the json-server and dev server to run concurrently in this app.

Api's will be listening in the port 3005 and the **URL** is *http://localhost:3005/rule_set*
